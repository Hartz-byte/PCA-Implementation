# PCA-Implementation in Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)

A simple and effective implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Python and Scikit-learn to reduce dimensionality and visualize high-dimensional data.

## What is PCA?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction while preserving as much variance as possible. It transforms correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

## Features
- PCA using scikit-learn's built-in methods
- Visualization of explained variance
- 2D and 3D scatter plots of PCA-transformed data
- Dataset support (e.g., Iris, custom CSV)
- Code structured for clarity and reusability

---

## The script:
- Loads a dataset (default: Iris)
- Scales the features
- Applies PCA
- Shows explained variance
- Visualizes the PCA-reduced data
